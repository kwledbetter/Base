**Step 10** In the Arduino\libraries folder Paste the DCCpp_Uno folder.  

![Step 10](http://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?media/10.125855/full)  

**Step11:** Open the Arduino IDE (If it was already open close all Arduino IDE's that are open first).  

![Step 11](http://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?media/11.125856/full)  

**Step 12:** Click on Files and Select Examples then DCCpp_Uno.  

![Step 12](http://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?media/12.125857/full)  

**Step 13:** This should open another Arduino IDE window with DCCpp_Uno sketch loaded

**Step 14:** Review the [Motor Shield Pin Mappings.pdf](https://github.com/DccPlusPlus/Documentation/blob/master/Motor%20Shield%20Pin%20Mappings.pdf) file for your Combination of Arduino board & shield.  

**Step 15:** In the Arduino IDE Click on Config.h  

![Step 15](http://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?media/15.125867/full)  

**Step 16:** Select the correct options for your hardware.  

![Step 16](http://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?media/16.125864/full)  

**Step 17:** Click on Tools and select Arduino board, processor, and port for your hardware.  

![Step 17](http://www.trainboard.com/highball/index.php?media/17.125865/full)  

**Step 18:** Click the check mark to Verify the Sketch and the Right arrow to Upload to your board.
